// 1	Input Iterator				Can scan the container forward only once, can't change the value it points to (read-only);
// 2	Output Iterator				Can scan the container forward only once, can't read the value it points to (write-only);
// 3	Forward Iterator			Can scan the container forward multiple times, can read and write the value it points to;
// 4	Bidirectional Iterator		Same as previous one but can scan the container back and forth;
// 5	Random Access Iterator		Same as previous one but can access the container also non-sequentially (i.e. by jumping around);
// 6								Contiguous Iterator	Same as previous one, with the addition that logically adjacent elements are also physically adjacent in memory.
